# Java-Multi-threaded-Simulation

  Simulation to visualize real time thread allocation on a server, having a number of clients, taking an unknown time to serve,
and computed on dynamically allocatd threads, utilising a custom built thread pool. Number of clients and threads are stored
in a variable, diration of serving and moment of arrival are allocated randomly. Program displays all clients, and serving of
each one of them, in real time, duration of serving being in increments of 1s.
<br>
  Program utilises thread pool variables and lits to ensure thread safety.
